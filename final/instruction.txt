graphical calculator is able to find derivatives and integrals of polynomials 
and elementary trigonometric functions and draw their graph. The calculator 
does not support complex and composite functions.
The calculator has its own syntax. You can also write equations with spaces if you prefer.
To specify a polynomial, it is necessary to multiply some number to the x, 
if you want to write just x, then write "1*x" like this. 
if you write the equation in the wrong format, a window will appear 
warning about the incorrect format. 

examples:
taking derivative:
2*x^4+3*x-4 -> show derivative -> 8*x^3+3
the same if 2 * x ^ 4 + 3 * x - 4 -> show derivative -> 8*x^3+3
taking integral:
2*x^4+3*x-4 -> show integral -> 0.400*x^5+1.500*x^2-4*x+C
finding critical points:
if your equation is quadratic then calculator will calculate the
critical points and shows you. If solution of quadratic equation is not real 
then calculator will show that the no critical points

To indicate the degree of x, write "x^".
If you want to find the derivative, click on the "show derivative" button. 
The derivative can be calculated by specifying a value for x.
If you want to find the integral, click on the "show integral" button. 
The definite integral can be found by specifying the boundaries of the function.
To draw a graph, click on the "show graph" button and the function will 
draw you the function itself and its derivative.
